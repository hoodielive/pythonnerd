Notes on Subprocess Module 

- Supports 3 API(s) for working with processes.
  - The run() function added in Python 3.5 which is a high-level API for running process and optionally collecting its output.
    The functions call(), check_call(), and check_output() are 'former' high-level API, carried over from Python 2 (still supported).
  - The Popen() class is a low-level API used to build the other API(s) and useful for more complex process interactions. 
    The constructor for Popen takes args to set up the new process so that parent can communicate with it via pipes. Can close extra
    file descriptors and ensuring the pipes are closed. (Built-in) instead of being handled separately by the application code.
  - The subprocess module is intended to replace functions such as os.system(), os.spawnv(), variations of popen() in the os and popen2 modules
    and the commands module.
